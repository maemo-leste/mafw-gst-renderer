mafw-gst-renderer (0.1.2009.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * MAFW gst renderer, pre-release 0.2009.14-3
  * Fixes: NB#107595 - Xid not set error comes when video is played to the end and then played again with media player
  * Removed guessing the seekability from renderer in favor of only GStreamer
    query.
  * Setting pipeline to NULL without checking for async changes as it
    cannot happen according to Stefan comments.
  * Must always stop() on EOS when there are 
    no more items to play. This frees X resources if playing video,
    otherwise setting a new Xid afterward leads to a BadWindow X 
    error.
  * Enabling gstreamer optimization flags
  * Creating pipeline at startup and, soon after the playback has ended, to 
    speed up the starting of the playback
