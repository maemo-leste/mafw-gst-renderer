  * Added function to remove the _set_timeout and used not to call it twice
    innecessarily.
  * Changed the order of adding the timeout to set the volume to pulse and
    calling the timeout immediately as that runs on the mainloop and that
    execution is delayed to that

    when seeking (compare new state with worker state to decide
    if we have to ignore the state transition and in any case,
    always update the worker state).
  * Activate playbin2 flags. Speeds up video start time to half.

  * Fixed a small problem with mute. We were forgetting to set it when

    add the timeout to filter following changes.

    were setting.
  * Added protections to public methods so that they are not called when
    volume manager is not alive yet.

  * Fixes: NB#100842 - seeking in aac over http fails
  * Fixes: NB#115126 - Media Player abuses Tracker API while playing songs
  * Do not reuse video sink for now, somehow it gets
    broken after some time and as a result we cannot set XID of target
    video window to use.
  * Create and configure audio and video sinks once, then provide these
    to playbin2 when a new pipeline is created.
  * Changed _handle_duration to use _check_duration and added for
    seekability too.
  * Reworked _query_duration_and_seekability into _check_duration and _check
    seekability.
  * Added timeout to query duration and seekability and changed when it was
    called.
  * Set timeout id to 0 when timeout is removed
  * Used function to compare duration in seconds instead of comparing pure
    nano seconds.
  * Added function to compare durations in seconds.
  * Query duration and seek after buffering is complete.
  * Reworked adding the timeout to use a function.
  * Modified seekability emission to be done only with changes and adapted
    to type changes.
  * Modified duration emission to be emitted only with changes.
  * Media seekability initialized to unknown when playback begins.
  * SeekabilityType renamed and moved to renderer worker.
  * Renderer worker seekability uses its type now instead of gboolean.
  * Stored duration and seek timeout id to be able to remove it later in
    renderer worker.
  * Added query for duration and seekability some seconds after going to
    PLAYING to have more accurate information from GStreamer in renreder
    worker.
  * Reworked _finalize_startup in renderer worker into _finalize_startup and
    _query_duration_and_seekability. The first uses now the second.
  * Set pulse sink's latency-time property to half of buffer-time,
    this provides double buffering capabilities and should also help
    with avoiding audio glitches. Also, removed buffering for volume
    pipeline, since that is not needed.

  * Fixes: NB#110654 - mafw-dbus-wrapper prints about a critical error
  * Fixes: NB#103987 - Audio playback is breaking for few seconds while playing mms live streams.
  * Fixes power management issues caused by the volume pipeline
    being always in PAUSED state. While a proper implementation
    for volume management is not in place, this temporal fix
    workarounds the problem by setting it to PAUSED on demand
    when global volume has to be read, and then setting it back
    to READY.
  * Do not check video caps on prepare-xwindow-id, instead wait
    for prerolling to finish, otherwise caps are not set yet.
  * Use 'g_timeout_add_seconds' where possible.
  * Added monitor volume hack again, but when going to playing instead of
    stopping.
  * Revert "Added monitor_hack again but called only when stopping the worker."
  * Added monitor_hack again but called only when stopping the worker.

    reinstalls"
  * Improved playlist-change handling
  * Hack to monitor volume does not return TRUE, but FALSE and reinstalls
    the timeout not to do it at regular intervals, but a timeout after last
    callback is run.
  * Do not go to PLAYING state until we are done buffering.
  * Disable native flags in playbin2 temporarily since this is causing
    trouble with some videos. Also, allow videos with resolution 
    up to 848x576.
  * Added dirty hack to be aware of the volume changes that don't happen
    inside mafw code. As soon as GStreamer adds notify::volume signals, we
    have to remove this immediately.
  * Setting volume when playing is done only for playback volume.
  * Moved volume management from playback pipeline to volume pipeline. We
    don't update the volume pipeline because it should be updated but we do it
    with the playback one because it has always to be set up.
  * Moved listening to volume signals from playback pipeline to volume
    pipeline in renderer
  * Added customized pipeline to always listen to volume changes in renderer
  * Added support to distinguish between audio and video codec errors.
  * Fixed critical warning message.
  * When we get the ckey coming from the sync bus to the async bus, we check
    the caps and raise an error if they are not suitable.

  * MAFW gst renderer, pre-release 0.2009.14-3
  * Fixes: NB#107595 - Xid not set error comes when video is played to the end and then played again with media player
  * Removed guessing the seekability from renderer in favor of only GStreamer
    query.
  * Setting pipeline to NULL without checking for async changes as it
    cannot happen according to Stefan comments.
  * Must always stop() on EOS when there are 
    no more items to play. This frees X resources if playing video,
    otherwise setting a new Xid afterward leads to a BadWindow X 
    error.
  * Enabling gstreamer optimization flags
  * Creating pipeline at startup and, soon after the playback has ended, to 
    speed up the starting of the playback
